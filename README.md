If you can't find a reason to continue, give yourself a reason to start again, even if it's the craziest reason.
Call me Dinosaur, I'm a girl studying Artificial Intelligence and Robotics so I'll be a little drier than other girls. 
I have the ability to write and am also a content creator.
I like the sky the most, like watching the sky because there I see the peace and beauty that I need.
No one is perfect, but it's nice to be yourself.
